# swiftrouter

This is largely based on https://github.com/takebayashi/swiftra. I started playing with swiftra, and didn't like some of the things about it, so I set out to create my own version of it. The name, API and just about everything about this code base is subject to change. I may even entirely ditch this framework if someone smarter writes something better.

Docs and such will be on the way.
